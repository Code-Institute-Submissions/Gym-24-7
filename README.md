 ### Fonts
For this project I'm going to use the Montserrats and font for headings. It's both elegant and eyecatching yet simple. For paragraphs I'm going to use Roboto, Roboto is similar to Montserrat, the two fonts work great together.

### Colours
For the colours I have chosen to go with mainly dark grey and black, I want to keep it elegant. To highlight and keep it intresting I've added red. Red is the color of passion, I think that goes well this specific branding.

### Icons
For the Icons I'm using icons from the fontawesome CDN. The goal here is not to overuse them, keep it simple.

### Styling
For the overall styling of the project I'm using the foundation of Boostrap but on top of that I am using my own styling. 

### Images
The Images goes in the same overall feel and look with the rest of the colorscheme. They are also engaging and happy.
