 ### Fonts
For this project I'm going to use the Montserrats and font for headings. It's both elegant and eyecatching yet simple. For paragraphs I'm going to use Roboto, Roboto is similar to Montserrat, the two fonts work great together.

### Colours
For the colours I have chosen to go with mainly dark grey and black, I want to keep it elegant. To highlight and keep it intresting I've added red. Red is the color of passion, I think that goes well this specific branding.

### Icons
For the Icons I'm using icons from the fontawesome CDN. The goal here is not to overuse them, keep it simple.

### Styling
For the overall styling of the project I'm using the foundation of Boostrap but on top of that I am using my own styling. 

### Images
The Images goes in the same overall feel and look with the rest of the colorscheme. They are also engaging and happy.
This is the image I've chosen to use for the hero of the website. I used Photoshop to edit the colours a bit.

All pictures used is from either Pexels or Freepik. Both of these sites are for stockphotos. Every each one will be linked in credits.

### Backgrounds
For the background I'm using the colors I presented earlier. The body background is solid black, so the whole website is dark.

## Wireframes
I used Adobe XD to create the wireframes. Adobe XD is a prototype tool mostly used for creating mockups, wireframes and interactive prototypes. The wireframes I've done are very basic but straightforward.

## Testing
it is important that my site works as planned. So therefore I double test everything to make sure it works as intended.
I test the website by responsiveness and features. I also try to look through the spelling. When I feel like I've gone trought it all I validate the code with the wc3 CSS & HTML validators.

### Header & Navbar
* **Plan:** The header needs to be fully responsive, the header should include a navbar.

* **Implementation:** I used FreePik to find a fitting header image. Then I edited it in Photoshop to fit with the color scheme.
I added the header inside of a Boostrap jumbotron with the navbar. To make it look good on every screen size I changed the size of the image in Photoshop and linked it to the
jumbotron in the different media queries. I link the navlinks to the different sections of the HTML page. The navbar is a Boostrap navbar. It will collapse the navlinks into an icon at smaller screensizes. I customized this for my liking.

* **Test:** I test the responsivness of the header by opening the website in chrome and then resizing the window. I Also doublecheck in the chrome dev-tools, sometimes these two differs, the more correct one is the dev-tools one. I also doublechecked and looked at my website through my phone. I test to see if my nav links works by clicking them. I use the dev-tools to see if my navlinks collapse into my chosen icon properly.

* **Results:** The header work as intended. It is fully responsive on all screensizes. The navbar looks correct and the navlinks properly links to the different HTML-section linked. The navlinks correctly collapse into an icon at smaller sizes.

* **Verdict:** The header & navbar passed all the tests.

### Promocontainer
